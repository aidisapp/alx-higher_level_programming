# 0x02-python-import_modules

This repository contains solutions to tasks that focus on understanding and utilizing Python import mechanisms, modules, and command line arguments.

## Files

### 0-add.py
A program that imports a function from `add_0.py` and performs an addition operation.

### 1-calculation.py
A script that imports functions from `calculator_1.py` and performs basic arithmetic operations.

### 2-args.py
A program that prints the number of and the list of its arguments passed through the command line.

### 3-infinite_add.py
A script that prints the result of the addition of all arguments passed through the command line.

### 4-hidden_discovery.py
A program that prints all the names defined by the compiled module `hidden_4.pyc`.

### 5-variable_load.py
A script that imports a variable `a` from `variable_load_5.py` and prints its value.

## Tasks Overview

### Importing Functions
Task 0 involves importing a function `add(a, b)` from a file `add_0.py` and performing an addition operation.

### Working with Functions
Task 1 includes importing functions (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) from `calculator_1.py` and performing arithmetic operations.

### Handling Command Line Arguments
Task 2 focuses on creating a program that prints the number of arguments and their values passed through the command line.

### Handling Infinite Arguments
Task 3 involves creating a program that adds all arguments passed through the command line and prints the result.

### Module Exploration
Task 4 requires printing names defined by a compiled module `hidden_4.pyc` in alphabetical order.

### Variable Importing
Task 5 involves importing a variable `a` from a Python file and printing its value.

## Requirements

### General
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- Interpreter: Python 3.8.x
