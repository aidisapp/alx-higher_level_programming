# 0x03. Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples

## Overview

This project focuses on Python data structures, specifically lists and tuples. It aims to help you understand the fundamentals of these structures, their usage, and the differences between them. The project covers various topics, including list methods, list comprehensions, using lists as stacks and queues, and exploring tuples.
